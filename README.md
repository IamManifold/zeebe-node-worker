# zeebe-node-worker

Everything here is not to be trusted, I don't know what i'm doing but working through the zeebe process. 
Technially the code should be in a working state if it's on here but for this rep it probably won't be upkept. 

# yolotest.bpmn

my model from Zeebe Modeler

# index.js
Spools up workflow instance

# worker.js
creates workers for yolotest.bpmn tasks

# worker2.js
alternative way to create workers for yolotest.bpmn tasks
